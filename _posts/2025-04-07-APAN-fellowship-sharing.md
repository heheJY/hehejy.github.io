Hey everyone! 🌏

Today I want to share one of the most meaningful experiences I’ve had as an undergraduate — my first ever participation in the **Asia Pacific Advanced Network (APAN)** conference! 🎉

Before this, I honestly never imagined being part of such an international, prestigious community. But thanks to my lecturer and mentor, Dr. Ling, I stumbled into this opportunity, applied for the APAN Fellowship... and to my surprise — I was selected! 😱

Let me take you through my journey:

# What is APAN? 🌐

The **Asia Pacific Advanced Network (APAN)** is a collaborative platform that brings together researchers, educators, technologists, and students from across the Asia-Pacific region and beyond. It plays a huge role in supporting high-performance network infrastructure and encouraging knowledge exchange in areas like:

- Networking & Cloud Computing ☁️
- Cybersecurity 🔐
- Telemedicine 🏥
- Digital Humanities 📜
- AI, Data, and much more! 🤖

APAN holds **biannual meetings** that are packed with keynote speeches, technical talks, working group discussions, hands-on workshops, research presentations, fellowship programs, and even cultural exchanges. It’s where real-world collaboration happens, and where new voices like mine get to connect with global experts.

# My First Encounter with APAN 🎯

Honestly, I first heard about APAN from Dr. Ling. He introduced me to the **APAN Fellowship Program** and encouraged me to give it a shot. I applied without any big expectations, thinking “I’ll just try my luck.”

But then... I got selected! 🎉

The APAN Fellowship program generously covered my:

- Conference registration
- Accommodation
- Meals

Basically, all the financial burdens were taken care of, allowing me to fully focus on learning, connecting, and soaking in the experience.

# A Week Packed with Learning & Connections 🚀

The conference lasted five full days — and every day was loaded with technical sessions, workshops, discussions, and lots of networking. I had the chance to meet amazing peers and professionals from countries like:

- India 🇮🇳
- The Philippines 🇵🇭
- Pakistan 🇵🇰
- Taiwan 🇹🇼
- Bangladesh 🇧🇩
- ... and many more!

It was truly a global community, and I was amazed by how friendly and welcoming everyone was.

Some of the sessions that really stood out to me:

✅ **Segment Routing (SRv6)** — This session expanded my understanding of modern networking architecture, especially how service providers are evolving their backbone networks.

✅ **Network Automation** — Probably one of my favorites. Seeing practical tools, automation workflows, and real-world use cases gave me a clearer picture of how important programmability is becoming in networking. (This ties in so much with what I’m studying in university too!)

For someone like me, coming directly from university courses, these sessions were incredibly eye-opening. They made me realize how fast the industry is evolving — and how crucial it is to stay updated with skills like network automation, scripting, and programmable infrastructure.

# Real Collaboration in the Working Group Sessions 👩‍💻

One of the most valuable parts of APAN was joining the **Working Group (WG) sessions**, especially:

- **Cloud WG**  
- **Security WG**

Unlike regular lectures, these were active discussions where experts from different institutions presented ongoing projects, brainstormed solutions, and even welcomed input from fellows like me! 🗣️

I got to witness how real-world, cross-border collaboration happens in the research and education networking (REN) community. For a moment, I didn’t feel like “just a student” — I felt like I was part of a much bigger professional ecosystem. 🌍

# Beyond Tech: Cultural & Social Exchange 🌸

Of course, APAN wasn’t just about technical learning. It was also a beautiful cultural experience. During meals and casual chats, I got to connect with fellow students and professionals from so many different countries — discussing not only tech, but food, culture, and even career advice.

Ironically, in the middle of all the excitement, I forgot to take a photo of myself at the event venue. 😅 I really wish I had captured those memories visually — but maybe that shows how immersed I was in the moment! The experience is deeply etched in my memory, and honestly, the friendships I built are far more valuable than any selfie.

# Paying It Forward 🎁

Since coming back from APAN, I’ve been actively sharing my experience with my juniors and peers at Universiti Malaya. Many students don’t even realize that opportunities like **APAN Fellowship** exist!

I always encourage them to apply — because international exposure like this can be life-changing. You don’t need to be the “top student” or have crazy credentials. Sometimes you just need to take that first step and apply. 🌱

# Looking Ahead 🚀

I’m deeply grateful to:

- **APAN Fellowship Committee**
- **My mentor, Dr. Ling**
- **The entire APAN community**

This experience has inspired me to explore further studies and career opportunities in networking, cloud, and research. I hope I can attend future APAN conferences — maybe next time as a speaker or contributor! 💪

APAN is not just about cutting-edge technology. It’s about **people** — coming together, sharing knowledge, solving problems, and building a better-connected world. 🌐

I’m honored to have been a small part of it, and I hope to continue growing within this amazing global community.
